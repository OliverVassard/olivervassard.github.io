<p><em>Welcome to my blog!</em> I write here about my journey as a first-time entrepreneur.</p>

<hr>

<p>This will be a short post. As I have said last week, I committed myself to have a final decision on which niche(s) to target on by March 6st. I am now half-way through my research and have accomplished the tasks I set for myself last week, which were: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Payment Processors Research</strong> - I have now a pretty good idea of what&#39;s out there, what&#39;s possible and what&#39;s not. Of course, more question will pop up along the way, but for now I feel comfortable with what I know</li>
<li><strong>Niche Research</strong> - The same is true for the niche research. I think I have a now a good understanding about the various kinds of soloprenuer niches and already an idea of what I am probably going to focus on. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>These are the goals for week 10: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Competitive Research</strong> - My VA has sent me this morning the initial list of the competitors in soloprenuer invoicing &amp; billing space along with a couple of metrics I have asked for. I will now enrich this list with a couple of metrics myself. </li>
</ul>

<p>The whole point is to make sure that my product has a unique selling preposition (USP). And the concept I have in mind is so far unique, which is something I am very excited about. Sure, there could be a good reason for it - e.g. it is not technically feasible or that it is simply not that beneficial for customers in the first place. But for right now, my glass is half full and I am confident that both of these explanations are wrong. And I guess there is only one way to figure this out anyways. (Especially if you are an advocate of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Day-Startup-Learn-Launch-ebook/dp/B00NZFKB8S">Dan Norris&#39;s book &quot;The 7-Day Startup&quot;</a>, which argues that you don&#39;t learn until you launch.)</p>

<h3>Virtual Assistant</h3>

<p>On a final note I want express how much I value having a Virtual Assistant (VA for my administrative, research &amp; data entry tasks. Having one or more VAs can really leverage your startup and I recommend reading <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/virtual-assistant-startup.html">this great article</a>  by <a href="http://www.softwarebyrob.com">Rob Wallin</a> if you want to know more. My friend David Schneider from <a href="http://www.selfmadebusinessman.com/"><em>Selfmade Businessman</em></a> has also written <a href="http://www.selfmadebusinessman.com/2014/03/03/the-ultimate-guide-to-vas/">an awesome step-by-step guide on how to hire VAs</a> which shouldn&#39;t leave any question open.</p>
