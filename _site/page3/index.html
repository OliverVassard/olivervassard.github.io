<p><em>Welcome to my blog!</em> I write here about my journey as a first-time entrepreneur.</p>

<hr>

<p>Alright, here we go for the first review of my weekly commitments. I say it straight out, I did not complete the goals I set last week: I am still missing the decision on which niche(s) to focus on. </p>

<p>Why? Well, first of all - as always - I underestimated the amount of work which goes into it. A good rule of thumb would be to take my initial best estimate and multiply it by two, and sometimes even three.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s dig a little deeper: If you want to hit the sweet spot, you need to align all three sides of the following triangle: <strong><em>User goals, business goals &amp; technical goals.</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/triangle.jpg" alt="Thorben">
<em>Source: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/fling/designing-mobile-experiences-10013353">Brian Fling</a></em></p>

<p>I always thought I had a great good grip on user goals &amp; business goals of Paybeat. However I totally underestimated the technical goals part of it. I still think it&#39;s not a big challenge to build it, that&#39;s not the issue here. The issue is the extend to which the technical goals influences the other two sides of the triangle. </p>

<h4>Influence on Business Goals</h4>

<p>As an example, consider whether or not the payment processor allows me to customize something which is the known as the &quot;soft descriptor&quot;. Such a descriptor is basically the text which describes the transaction on your credit card or bank statement. If it&#39;s unclear to the customers where this transaction is coming from, they might disputed it. This can be relatively costly - i.e. it has a significant influence on the business goals.</p>

<h4>Influence on User Goals</h4>

<p>Another example is whether you want to let the users create their own merchant accounts e.g. with &quot;Stripe Connect&quot;. Even though these accounts are free and take only 2 minutes to sign up for, they add considerably more friction to the user expierence. This is especially important when you build an app which competitive advantage largely lies in its simplicity and ease of use. And now imagine that you also might have to sign up for a separate merchant account in order to accept ACH payments. This example shows how the technical feasibility influences the user goals.</p>

<h4>Competition</h4>

<p>But its not only the technical feasibility which requires more research, so does the competition. I was always sure that everyone of my competitors charges the same transaction fees and that these competitors use their feature set to differentiate themselves. This believe was destroyed when I came across a startup which charged considerably lower transaction fees than what every one else is doing. I can at the moment not explain how they can make this happen (especially when its a free app), other than that they are VC-backed and primarily aim to build a large user base. It would be a bad choice for a bootstrapper to compete with this startup. This competitor was not on my radar because it was hiding in niche. This means that I also need to spend more time doing competitive research. </p>

<h4>Research Paralysis?</h4>

<p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong - I am well aware of the term &quot;research paralysis‚Äù and many argue that this is also only a fancier term for procrastination. You can of course never remove all uncertainty and this is also what makes entrepreneurship exciting. Therefore I have <strong>committed myself to have a final decision on which niche(s) to target on by March 6st!</strong></p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>These are the goals for week 9: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Payment Processors Research</strong> - Make a spreadsheet of the most popular payment processors on the market and collect all relevant details. </li>
<li><strong>Niche Research</strong> - Enhancing my spreadsheet of relevant niches with columns like <em>transaction frequency</em> &amp; <em>transaction volume</em>. Furthermore I will research the invoicing &amp; payment workflows as well as the regulations which govern these niches. </li>
</ul>

<p>The competitive research is due for next week. I have assigned my Virtual Assistant to create an initial list with a couple of easy-to-obtain details so that I dont have to start from scratch next week and can focus on the most important issues of the research. </p>
