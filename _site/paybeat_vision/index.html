<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>PayBeat - Send invoices straight from Gmail within seconds</li>
<li>Job: Getting you paid fast, cheap &amp; conveniently</li>
<li>Customers: Web-based freelancers (WBF)</li>
<li>Plattform: Gmail (Google Chrome Extension) + Mobile (iOS/Android) </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Elevator Pitches</h2>

<h3>For Peers</h3>

<p><em>PayBeat is the simplest way for freelancers to get paid. What makes it different then any other invoicing app out there, is that it works straight out of Gmail.</em> </p>

<p><em>While it would seem that Freelancers would be highly motivated to send the invoice, human nature tends to get in the way. Invoicing is perceived as tedious work and easy to put off.</em></p>

<p><em>So why not overcome this by piggy-backing on an well-established habits? Freelancers spent all day in their email Gmail inbox anyways, so why not make invoicing a part of it?</em></p>

<p><em>This means there is no need to open up any separate tabs and applications. No need to build and maintain a separate set of contact data.</em></p>

<p><em>Instead, they can send out and manage all of their invoices right form your Gmail message window - which is as frictionless as it can get.</em></p>

<p><em>Besides being super convenient, the app also offers other benefits which freelancer appreciate - like flexible billing and payments methods. (e.g. recurring billing plans and cheap eCheck payments)</em> </p>

<h3>For Customers</h3>

<p><em>PayBeat is the simplest way to get you paid.</em></p>

<p><em>Invoicing is tedious work and easy to put off. While it would seem that one would be highly motivated to send the invoice, human nature tends to get in the way.</em></p>

<p><em>We understand that! And thats why PayBeat works just like you do: Right out of Gmail! No need to open up any separate tabs and applications. No need to build and maintain a separate set of contact data.</em> </p>

<p><em>You can send out and manage all your invoices right form your Gmail message window - which is as simple as it can get.</em> </p>

<p><em>So it is for your clients, which can pay the invoices fast with a single click, even from their phones</em>.</p>

<p><em>Do you have complex billing needs? - set up recurring payments or payments plans.</em>  <em>Are you annoyed of high cards fees? - accept super cheap eCheck payments.</em> </p>

<hr>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Invoicing is tedious</strong> work and easy to put off. While it would seem that Freelancers would be highly motivated to send the invoice, human nature tends to get in the way.  (<a href="http://tiempoapp.com/blog/how-to-pay-independent-contractors#sthash.N4cDJPss.dpuf">See here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>WBF spent most of their time in the email inbox, which is their mayor hub of client communication. However in order to generate &amp; send an invoice they <strong>need to log in to seperate application</strong>. This adds frictions to the process. </p></li>
<li><p>WBF need <strong>flexible billing option</strong> - one-time payments, recurring payments (retainers) and/or payment plans. This depends often on the project type &amp; scope.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Getting paid fast</strong> - Let me quote <a href="http://thecreativeclass.io">Paul Jarvis, creator of the thecreativeclass.io</a>: <em>&quot;Larger companies typically have time-based invoice payment terms, like Net30 or Net90. This means the other party has 30 or 90 days to pay. Many freelancers automatically adopt this practice, too – and while net payment terms might be wise for big companies, they’re not a good idea for freelancers. Here’s why.If you’re hired for a project and spend your time finishing each deliverable, you should be paid right when the deliverable is complete and approved – not 30 or 90 days later. The whole project could be done by then. If there’s no lag in your work for the client, there should be no lag in their payment. That means Net0.&quot;</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Card fees</strong> are still high, which is a problem especially for younger freelancers. </p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>The Solution - A Gmail Plugin</h2>

<h3>Why an email plugin?</h3>

<p>I believe that using the email program as a platform is a great idea. WBFs are most of their time in their inboxes anyways.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://paydirtapp.com/blog/track-time-in-gmail-using-paydirt/">Paydirt Blog</a>: <em>&quot;If you&#39;re like us, you probably spend all day in your Gmail inbox.&quot;</em></p>

<p>From the <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/blog/page/3/">Harvest Blog</a>: <em>&quot;Google Apps is ingrained in our workflow here at Harvest, and many of our customers share the same story — checking e-mails in Gmail, collaborating on docs in Drive, and more.&quot;</em></p>

<p>From the <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/organize-search-automate-gmail-inbox/">Zapier Blog</a>: <em>&quot;Like it or not, email is often the cornerstone of your personal and professional communications.&quot;</em></p>

<p>So why not building an invoicing application which works &quot;natively&quot; in your email application? I am sure that this has potential to substantially reduce friction in the process. Here is why:</p>

<ol>
<li>You <strong><a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/how-to-build-habit-forming-products-part-1-the-habit-loop/">piggy-back on a well-established habit</a></strong> - which is working in your email inbox.</li>
<li>You <strong>don&#39;t need to log into another application</strong> / working in a separate tab. </li>
<li>You will as a result (if the app is designed probably) be able to generate and send out an invoice with <strong>less clicks and and in less time</strong>. </li>
<li>You can utilize the momentum of the situation. You can send out the <strong>invoice immediately and thereby utilize the momentum</strong> of the situation to get the client to pay the invoice. (e.g. while still on the phone with the client where you can help them with any questions or concerns they might have)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Why Gmail?</h3>

<p>Sure there are other providers out there, but <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/01/technology/gmail/">Gmail the world&#39;s largest email service</a> with 500 Million+ active users. </p>

<h4>Gmail is popular among WBFs</h4>

<p>I also believe that Gmail is popular among my targeted demographic. <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/04/01/average-gmail-user/">One study</a> found that 68% of Gmail users were in the 18-34 range (with age 31 being the average age), likely to be thin, young men with liberal political slants. They were single, childless, not particularly religious and enjoyed reading blogs. I don&#39;t know about you, but this description matches the my image of the archetype WBF. </p>

<h4>Gmail plugins are getting more mainstream.</h4>

<p>Until recently I have perceived Gmail plugins as experimental, a sort of gimmicky applications. However the recent success of &quot;native&quot; Gmail plugins like <a href="https://rapportive.com">Rapportive</a> (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/07/linkedin-picks-up-rapportive-for-around-15-million/">acquired by Linked In for $ 15 Million</a>), <a href="http://www.yesware.com">Yesware</a>, <a href="https://www.streak.com">Streak</a> and new exciting startups like <a href="https://mixmax.com">MixMax</a> shows that Gmail plugins are now serious applications people are willing to pay for. </p>

<p>I also believe that &quot;native&quot; Gmail plugins (those that have been build for Gmail from scratch) will always have advantage over those types of plugins which have been developed as an afterthought.</p>

<h4>Gmail already has all contacts available.</h4>

<p>Gmail itself automatically collects &amp; saves as many contact details as possible. No need to enter or sync these into a third party application (such as separate invoicing apps, CRM or address book). Thier autocomplete function is blazing fast. Many people use the gmail contact directory as their master dataset anyways. And the recent announcement of a <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-new-google-contacts-bringing.html">new powerful Google Contacts App</a> will only make it only more attractive. </p>

<h4>Gmail has a powerful search</h4>

<p>Speaking of blazing-fast. So is the Gmail search algorithm. If you like me, you have never deleted an email. I have almost 40,000 emails in my inbox and I almost always find the email I am looking within seconds. This means that you can find email correspondents related to your invoices within seconds and within the same application.  </p>

<h4>Gmail has a great plugin ecosystem</h4>

<p>As a Gmail user, there are dozens of ways to customize, sort, and arrange the app to make it markedly more manageable. In such an ecosystem, there are many opportunities to leverage the functionality of PayBeat. Want email tracking on your invoices? Try <a href="http://mailtrack.io/en/">MailTrack</a>. Want to send an invoice later? Use <a href="http://www.mxhero.com">MxHero</a>. Want to automatically enrich your contact data? Have a look at <a href="http://www.evercontact.com">Evercontact</a>! Need a CRM functionality like deal flows? Install <a href="https://www.streak.com">Streak</a>. I think you get the idea...</p>

<h2>The Target Customer</h2>

<h3>A few words about the freelancer economy</h3>

<p>Freelancers &amp; contractors, the so-called 1099ers (named after the IRS tax form which they use to report thier earnings) are on the rise. Not just in the US but all around the world. Reliable numbers are hard to come by as there are so many ways to slice &amp; dice the data. Here some highlights: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>34% of North American workers now consider themselves freelancers or independent contractors</strong>, and their work adds $715 billion to the economy every year. (<a href="http://thecreativeclass.io/guide/">See here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3 million freelancers and roughly 50 million independent contractors in the US.</strong> (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/on-the-go-freelancers-get-business-a-business-management-tool-with-pocketsuite/">See here</a>) The distinction between these two, however, is a bit hazy. (<a href="http://www.mbopartners.com/independents-guide/plan/what-is-independent-consulting">See here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Millennials (workers under 35) are more likely to freelance</strong> -- 38% of Millennials are freelancing (compared to 32% of those over 35) (<a href="http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/independent-workforce-index.html">See here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sources of work</strong> - 75% use word-of-mouth as main source of work. The second rated source of work is talent agencies and brokers, with 12% listing this as their top source and 21% listing it in their top 3. Online talent marketplaces (Elance-oDesk, Freelancer.com, etc.) score low in terms of being a primary or secondary source of work for the solopreneur 15 hour+ group. Just 3% listed these as their number 1 source and 10% in their top three. However, they are relatively important for young and inexperienced independent workers, with 18% of Gen Y independents. 21% of those who have been independent for less than 1 year listed online talent marketplaces in their top three sources of work. (<a href="http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/independent-workforce-index.html">See here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Future of freelancing</strong> - Key drivers of the independent workforce – structural shifts in the economy; cheaper, better and more accessible technology; improved networks; and more acute interest in steering our own personal and professional lives — remain in place and, if anything, are growing stronger.(<a href="http://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence/independent-workforce-index.html">See here</a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Selection criteria</h3>

<p>Needless to say, freelancer are a pretty diversified group with a lot of different needs. Hence, I had to come up with a bunch of criteria to figure out who would be actually benefitting most from PayBeat:</p>

<ul>
<li>Working mainly remotely</li>
<li>Working mainly in front of a computer</li>
<li>Invoice often</li>
<li>Require flexible billing options (one-time, recurring payments, etc.) </li>
<li>Are not regulated </li>
<li>Do not use specialized billing standards (such as medical billing codes, etc) </li>
</ul>

<h3>Target segment: &quot;Web-based freelancer&quot;</h3>

<p>Based on these criteria, I have decided to focus on what I would call &quot;Web-based (or browser-based) Freelancers&quot; which would be in the ballpark of 2 million Americans:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web Developers</li>
<li>Software Developers</li>
<li>Online Marketing Experts</li>
<li>Writers</li>
<li>Illustrators, Designers &amp; other Creatives</li>
<li>Virtual Assistants</li>
<li>Life &amp; Business Coaches</li>
<li>Independent Consultants</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other segments</h3>

<p>This software could also be used by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Financial Advisors</li>
<li>Accountants</li>
<li>Lawyers</li>
<li>Physical Therapists &amp; Occupational Therapists</li>
<li>Psychologists / Psychartists</li>
<li>Therapists / Counsellors</li>
<li>Wellness Coaches</li>
<li>Dietitians</li>
</ul>

<p>These segments do however not match the last two criteria (&quot;not regulated&quot;, &quot;specialized billing procedures&quot;) and are therefore not the center of my focus.(i.e. I wont market directly to them). Nonetheless, PayBeat might still be very beneficial for them. </p>

<p>PayBeat is not intended for &quot;on-the-go&quot; freelancers like Home Cleaner, Dog Walkers, Window Cleaners, Photographers, Handymen Services, Fitness Trainers, Interior Designers etc..</p>

<h2>User Goals</h2>

<h3>Need-to-have</h3>

<ul>
<li>Simple &amp; fast to use right out of the email app</li>
<li>Flexible billing methods (one-time payments, recurring payments, payments plans)</li>
<li>Flexible payment methods (credit/debit cards &amp; bank transfers)</li>
<li>Cheap payment methods (bank transfers)</li>
<li>&quot;Mobile-optimized&quot; invoices (responsive design) and payment (Google Wallet integration / Pre-populated payment data via cookies) to get paid faster</li>
</ul>

<h3>Nice-to-have?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mobile app?</li>
<li>Hosted product pages?</li>
<li>Auto-responder to be trigger at different point during the client workflow?</li>
<li>Account system integrations?</li>
<li>Open API + Zapier integration?</li>
<li>Analytics dashboard?</li>
<li>...a million more cool (useful?) features I can think of which will probably never be implemented because THIS SHOULD BE AN EXTREMELY SIMPLE-TO-USE APPLICATION. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Competitive Edge</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>There is no <strong>Gmail plugin</strong> for invoicing application out there. Seriously, I had a look at approx. 150 web-based invoicing application and I couldn&#39;t find any which offers this functionality. Note that this could be also a bad sign e.g. its not technically feasible or people simply don&#39;t want it. Both explanations are hard to believe for me, especially the latter one as I people I showed my early mockups to got very excited about this functionality. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bank-transfers</strong> (eChecks in the US) are rare among competitors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recurring payments</strong> (as opposed to recurring invoicing) is rare among competitors.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Business Goals</h2>

<p>As I said above, I would estimate my target segment to be around 2 million Americans. Lets say that 20% could benefit from a a SaaS-based invoicing solution. This is probably a bit conservative, but this would give is 400,000 potential users. Lets now say that I am able to catch 2% of that group, which is 8,000 clients.</p>

<p>Pricing the product at $15 per month, this would mean $120,000 in monthly recurring revenue. Now, there is nothing which says that this product should be limited to the US market. If I integrate with one or more payment processors which are operating worldwide (Stripe is on a good path), I don&#39;t see any reason why an why PayBeat cannot be used worldwide either. </p>

<p>A &quot;free plan&quot; could be offered by taking a percentage on top of the transaction fees by the payment processors. This would lower the barrier for prospective clients to explore the app, while still getting paid for the service offered. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Technical Goals</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>I have already seen the most important UI/UX elements I plan to implement in Gmail-based applications like <a href="www.Sunrise.am">Sunrise</a> or <a href="mixmax.com">MixMax</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stripe Connect</strong> seams to be a great way payment provider for this use. However, <strong>WePay</strong> offers ACH payments and white label options which are very interesting for me as well. <strong>Balanced</strong> &amp; <strong>Braintree</strong> have for sure their own specific advantages (and disadvantages). The payment infrastructure market is still a bit confusing, although I have spent a more than a week studying it. The issue of the selection the right payment processor(s) is defiantly something which still needs some attention once the new mockups are ready &amp; tested. </p></li>
<li><p>Mobile apps will be tightly integrated with the Gmail API to ensure the a consistent UX with the web version  </p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Riskiest Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Its is technically feasible</li>
<li>It is a lot more convenient to invoice directly from Gmail than it is with competing stand-alone solutions.</li>
<li>The lack of a time-tracker is not a deal breaker, because A) clients don&#39;t bill by the hours anyways and B) they use other more sophisticated time-tracking solutions. </li>
<li>Google will always be nice to Google Apps developers. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Alternative Names</h2>

<p>PayBeat.io and PayBeat.co (which I own, Paybeat.com is taken and for sale for $2000) are both sexy names, but can we make it even more sexy with a short, easy-to-pronouce dot-com name?</p>

<ul>
<li>sidup.com</li>
<li>bomoc.com</li>
<li>mocum.com</li>
<li>bofog.com</li>
<li>qodus.com</li>
<li>fanyl.com</li>
<li>wanyl.com</li>
<li>hymob.com</li>
</ul>

<p>Or maybe a little more payment-related?</p>

<ul>
<li>payo.io</li>
<li>payol.io</li>
<li>payco.io</li>
<li>paygo.io</li>
<li>Payfu.io</li>
<li>Paylo.io </li>
<li>payat.io</li>
</ul>
