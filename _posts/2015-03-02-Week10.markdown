*Welcome to my blog!* I write here about my journey as a first-time entrepreneur.

-----
This will be a short post. As I have said last week, I committed myself to have a final decision on which niche(s) to target on by March 6st. I am now half-way through my research and have accomplished the tasks I set for myself last week, which were: 

* **Payment Processors Research** - I have now a pretty good idea of what's out there, what's possible and what's not. Of course, more question will pop up along the way, but for now I feel comfortable with what I know
* **Niche Research** - The same is true for the niche research. I think I have a now a good understanding about the various kinds of soloprenuer niches and already an idea of what I am probably going to focus on. 

###Goals

These are the goals for week 10: 

* **Competitive Research** - My VA has sent me this morning the initial list of the competitors in soloprenuer invoicing & billing space along with a couple of metrics I have asked for. I will now enrich this list with a couple of metrics myself. 

The whole point is to make sure that my product has a unique selling preposition (USP). And the concept I have in mind is so far unique, which is something I am very excited about. Sure, there could be a good reason for it - e.g. it is not technically feasible or that it is simply not that beneficial for customers in the first place. But for right now, my glass is half full and I am confident that both of these explanations are wrong. And I guess there is only one way to figure this out anyways. (Especially if you are an advocate of [Dan Norris's book "The 7-Day Startup"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Day-Startup-Learn-Launch-ebook/dp/B00NZFKB8S), which argues that you don't learn until you launch.)


###Virtual Assistant 

On a final note I want express how much I value having a Virtual Assistant (VA for my administrative, research & data entry tasks. Having one or more VAs can really leverage your startup and I recommend reading [this great article](http://blog.asmartbear.com/virtual-assistant-startup.html)  by [Rob Wallin](http://www.softwarebyrob.com) if you want to know more. My friend David Schneider from [*Selfmade Businessman*](http://www.selfmadebusinessman.com/) has also written [an awesome step-by-step guide on how to hire VAs](http://www.selfmadebusinessman.com/2014/03/03/the-ultimate-guide-to-vas/) which shouldn't leave any question open.
